#Website Blocker and Pomodoro Timer

This GitHub repository contains a simple yet effective tool designed to enhance productivity by minimizing distractions and fostering focused work sessions. The repository consists of two main components: a website blocker and a Pomodoro timer.

#Website Blocker
The website blocker is a script that allows users to block all websites and prevent access to them during dedicated work periods. By blocking access to sites known for consuming valuable time, users can maintain concentration and stay on task. The blocker operates by modifying the system's host file to redirect specified website URLs to a local IP address, effectively rendering them inaccessible during work sessions.

#Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the website blocker script.
Open the popup.html file and add the URLs of distracting websites you wish to block.
Run on the window browser.
During work sessions, the specified websites will be inaccessible, helping you stay focused.

#Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro timer is a productivity technique that involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This method aims to improve focus and productivity by working in short, concentrated bursts followed by brief periods of rest. The Pomodoro timer included in this repository allows users to customize work and break durations according to their preferences.

#Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the Pomodoro timer script.
Open the popup.html file and adjust the work and break durations as desired.
Run on the window browser.
Begin your work session, adhering to the intervals set by the Pomodoro timer. Take short breaks between work intervals to recharge and maintain productivity.
